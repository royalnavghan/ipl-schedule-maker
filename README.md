IPL (Indian Premier League) is a popular cricket tournament.

Total 8 teams participate in the tournament Lets say Team A - Team H. Each team belongs to a different city. Each team is supposed to play with the other team twice.
For example Team A has to play with Team C, twice, but once in the city which Team A represents and once in the city which Team C represents.

The program should accept the start day of the tournament, and create a fixture table which ensures the conditions are met. The Fixture table must contain the following as columns

Match #, Date, Team Names (Team A Vs Team C), City.
